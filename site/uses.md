# Uses

These are a few of the tools I use to build this site.

[Getting Things Done][]
: this book makes getting things done... doable. It's in the title.

MacBook Pro
: I've got one with a touchbar, and it did not change my life.

Terminal
: the baked in system terminal on `macOS` works for me.

Safari
: when everyone uses Chrome or Firefox, it's a superpower to develop in Safari and catch bugs before they ship.

[Visual Studio Code][]
: I got tired of configuring `vim`. Configuring `VSCode` is a breeze, and the `vim` bindings are good enough for 98% of what I do day-to-day.

[Eleventy][]
: the best static site generator for me.

[Netlify][]
: makes deploying a static site effortless.
