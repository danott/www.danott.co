Northbound and southbound are the only required stops at this four way intersection.
Eastbound and westbound have free reign to t-bone, and it'd be the pole-seeker's fault.

The 600cc engine announced its approach.
Two wheels southbound.
Not loud enough to annoy, but present enough to draw attention.
I looked up from my book and sipped my tea.

All that hair blowing opposite the forward momentum.
Helmets be damned.
I'm confident they were having the time of their lives.
Who can say, as the familiar hue of light blue personal protective equipment masked the smiles.

Whatever their fate, it's reassuring to see someone responding to statistical risk by wearing the recommended equipment.
