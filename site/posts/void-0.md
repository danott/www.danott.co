A few years ago I bought coffee in L.A.
I swiped my card.
They gave me a coffee and emailed me a receipt.
A few coupons trickled into my inbox.
But that was basically the end of the relationship.

Until this morning.
Overnight the company emailed me about how they're personally responding to COVID-19.
I deleted the message on subject line alone.
Sorry!
It just isn't information I need right now.

To be fair, even the occasional coupon in L.A.
isn't information I need, ever.
The receipt is all I needed

That's not entirely true.Â I needed that coffee.
And there was a croissant involved.
And the shared table with some favorite people.
The socializing that shaped a weekend.
The distance we traveled to be together.
I needed that memory
