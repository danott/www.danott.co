This is hard to talk about.
I may lose some friends and family over this.
But Christmas is the time to rejoice in the truth.

Iâ€™ve never read a Harry Potter book.
Maybe Iâ€™ve watched a movie or two, but I certainly donâ€™t remember them.
If youâ€™re putting deposits into our relationship that are compounded by this wizarding interest, itâ€™s been lost on me.

Iâ€™m so sorry.
I can quote anything from The Office.
Iâ€™ll get maybe two thirds of the Star Wars references.
But when it comes to summoning your Patronous points for Gryffendore, Iâ€™m snatch out of luck.

I do know that Snape kills Dumbledore because of an internet meme from the time of release.
I ruined that surprise for a close friend at the time.

Iâ€™m sorry for being a bad friend.
