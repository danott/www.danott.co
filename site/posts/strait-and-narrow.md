title: Strait & Narrow
---

Here's the deal.
The strait and narrow path is the easy way.
No turning to the left.
Nor the right.
The body in motion wants to continue it's trajectory.
So keep on strait while avoiding distractions.

But here's what they failed to mention.
The strait and narrow path is not easy in all respects.
It has plenty of elevation changes.
Steeper with every step.

Going uphill costs twice as much as veering to the left to avoid the pain.
But the calves-burning view from the top pays thirty, sixty, and a'hundred fold.

Get focused.
Move forward.
And quit fooling yourself that it's going to be pain free.

The body will rest.
The mind will be satisfied.
The mirror will smile.
