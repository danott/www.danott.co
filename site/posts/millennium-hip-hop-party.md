Is anybody else out there “I owned _Millennium Hip-Hop Party_ ” years old?
What a moment in time.

Ripping and burning CDs was becoming more common, but the hardware wasn’t guaranteed.
MP3 players existed, but only found usage among early adopters.
Y2K was the future, and Conan O’Brien was our prophet in what was to come “in the year 2000”.

We still bought playlists from Best Buy.
_Millennium Hip-Hop Party_ was the penultimate.
Maybe in close competition with ESPN’s _Jock Jams_.

Then came mixtapes on CDs.
Nero burned _Millennium Dan Ott Party_ volumes one through 14 if I remember correctly.
Volume 8 was the best.
But it’s lost to time.

My computer no longer has an optical drive.
Syncing MP3s to my iPod isn’t a thing.
_My iPod_ isn’t a thing.
Shoot, it wasn’t a thing before the millennium came.
A world changing device that is already a blip in the rear view mirror.
It’s feature set tucked into a corner of my iPhone.

My Winamp library received hours of curation.
It morphed into my iTunes library which now sits idle.
Instead I pay rent to Spotify for the same music across all my devices—30-pin connector and time-spent-sync’ing free.
The upside is I can [share the nostalgia](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gSVYllYWUsJzAA3anVn61?si=r16HsyvaT4S1X0hUpZiWjw) with you.

I don’t miss managing my music library.
But I do miss remembering the names of songs.
Maybe that’s more a function of the years lived than the tools passing through my hands.
