title: My Kingdom for an Abstraction

"It's one of those situations where [reaches for an abstraction]."

This argument has taken root in my heart, and sprouts from my mouth perennially.
Each flowering appeals for a predictable pattern.
A greater sense of meaning.
An historical lineage.
An unwavering trend that demands the time spent searching for it.

Instead of attacking problems head on, a story serves as substitute.
A fairy tale where the current indecision is reduced to an archetype of something that happened long ago.
No longer do I have to wrestle with the nuance of the situation at hand.
I can pick from all the available narratives to rationalize my indecisiveness.

Instead of talking about the facts, a similar problem from an unrelated domain is substituted.
Navigating my mental map by surveying the unfamiliar landscape makes for a beautiful broad strokes painting.
But it's simply tourism while avoiding the work at home.

I can't be wasting my time dealing with small problems.
The energy I've spent thinking this through _has_ to be an investment, serving a greater set of future problems.
My strategy for life needs to operate at scale.

Sometimes.
Most times.
It's not _one of those_.
It's just _that_.
It's not an opportunity for the algorithm.
It's not an abstraction waiting to be identified.
It's the present, and I'd do well to be wrapped up in it.
