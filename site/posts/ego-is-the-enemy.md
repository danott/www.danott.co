I loved this book.
The only downfall of this book is that I consumed it via audible, so I don't have a list of highights to revisit and think deeply on.

The title says it all.
My ego is my enemy.
It will get in the way of accomplishing great things.
It will increase unnecessary desires when contentedness is easily available.
It will push others down to lift myself up.

There's a fair mix of storytelling and abstract ideas.
They compliment each other very well.

This will become a yearly read for me for the foreseeable future.
