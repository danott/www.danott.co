Something beautiful happened a few years ago.
We were all gathered together.
Not us only, but them as well.

Strangers.
Occupying the same space.
Enjoying a meal.
Seeing things differently.
Ultimately breaking into song.

Uncertainty at first.
Voices snowballed.
Even more, now.
Emotions swelled in anticipation of the chorus.
The entire fire code occupancy of the brewery rose to their potential.

> Bye bye Li’l Sebastian\
> Miss you in the saddest fashion\
> Bye bye Li’l Sebastian\
> You’re 5000 candles in the wind

Parks & Recreation trivia may be the most joy filled mass gathering of witness this decade.
