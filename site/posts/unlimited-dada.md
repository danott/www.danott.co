I’m at the age where my friends’ dads are dying.
The first death sprung up as an anomaly.
The second even more so.
The third we knew was coming.
And ever since there seems to be a steady current of sad news.

And as it goes, I admit anew that my dad too will die.
I’ve known this from the moment of discovering death.
But it’s become palpable.
Almost present.

There’s not much to do about it.
By the grace of God I have a good relationship with my dad.
He’s become quite the grandpa in these recent years.

We’ll enjoy some firepits, baseball games, and hikes between now and then.
I’ll give a eulogy, grieve, and invest in my children's memories to be slowly forgotten all the same.
