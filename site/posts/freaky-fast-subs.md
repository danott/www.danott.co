There was a wreck on US27 today.
Things moved slow.
Single lane out of seven slow.

All the institutions were represented.
Police.
Fire brigade.
EMT.
Jimmy Johns.

Jimmy Johns was totaled.
Airbag continuously deployed.
A freaky fast broken promise.
The speed of delivery almost cost this carrier their life.

The speed of it all is costing thousands.
Iâ€™m thankful for a moment to slow down and reflect.
