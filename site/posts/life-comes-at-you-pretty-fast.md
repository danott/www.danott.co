title: Life comes at you pretty fast

Life comes at you pretty fast.
And this was one of those high speed weeks.
Disruption to family, schedule, and predictability.

I had time set aside to write before the storm.
I chose to write something lower on my todo list, when my weekly Tinyletter was on the top of my todo list.

So now I'm at the end of my week, knowing I want to publish once a week, but not having my post to publish.
So stream-of-consciousness wins the day.

Learning out loud:</div>

- SchedulingÂ priorities is a different hobby than keeping to a schedule
- Buying books is a different hobby than reading books
- Acquiring organization tools is a different activity than being organized

Planning to do the thing is the setup, but it doesn't replace doing the thing.
I want to do the thing.
