Carl Sagan was a brilliant thinker.
Having never read his works before, I wasn't quite sure what to expect.
The offerings in this book were diverse, and even when it felt slow, it remained interesting.

The biggest question I have, is "who hurt you Carl Sagan"?
While his ambitions for humanity's future in space are beautiful, humanity's past seemed to be viewed with an attitude of elitism and scorn.
The artificial divide between faith and science is rampant, and uniform measures are not applied.

Some of the technology that took us to the moon was created in Nazi Germany as instruments of death a mere 60 years ago... totally forgivable and glazed over.
A minortity of people of faith got things wrong 600 years ago (while other people of faith were persuing exploration as a means of appreciating their God's creation)... everyone who has believed in something that cannot be seen at any period in history should be dismissed and labeled as degenerate savages who are holding back the species.
This is, of course, some hyperbole.
But it's no greater than that used by the author when arguing for his position.

The inconsistent measures aside, the bulk of the work is equal parts inspiring and educational.
Philosphy, politics, humanity, and science are all drivers in Carl's objective to encourage manned missions of space exploration.
A humbling read in many respects.
