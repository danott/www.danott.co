Here's the deal.

It's January first and I have no resolutions.
Aspirations and ideals, maybe.
And plans are forming.

A few projects are in the works.
First actions taken today.
The second actions lined up all tidy in my organization system of choice.

Other projects have no start date.
That's okay.
I will start, someday.

A social media fast?
Sure, why not.

The Celebration of Missing Out.

Buy local.
Love local.
Be local.
Be.

Wander like a sheep with a shepherd.
New year, new ewe.
