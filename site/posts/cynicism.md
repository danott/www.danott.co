One of the great lies I’ve told myself is that cynicism is an intellectual ascent.
I bought into the brand of jadedness and dissolution as virtue.
I wore these tired and trending vestments as an excellent consumer should.

Some of these old rags still hang in my closet.
I habitually reach for their warmth when I fear the incoming cold front of the unknown.
I haven’t discarded cynicism wholesale, but I’m working on it.

The greatest encouragement I received recently communicated progress.
I’m still embracing reality, but cynicism is being replaced by judgement-free-matter-of-factness rooted in hope.

The glass is half empty.
But I need to stretch my legs&mdash;and that’s a good excuse as any to go fill it.
