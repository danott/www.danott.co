**LOST** was starting in five minutes.
Exchanging dares to commit stupid acts needed to wrap up.
Or did they?

"Low ball to continuously apply hand lotion during the entire episode?"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Are commercial breaks part of the episode?"

"Yes."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"..."

"..."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I'd do that if you buy me a [Domino's] thin crust with pepperoni, sausage, and mushrooms."

He dialed the phone.
I made an inaugural pump of the lotion.
For an entire block of prime time, hand lotion was applied in a manner honoring it's namesake.
Continuously.
Through commercials.
Through the exchange of theories.
After a while, there's no need to re-apply.
The skin stops soaking up any more moisture.
A white film collects, and hovers over the surface.
Not Penny's boat.

Once my hands were freed from their commitment, a collection of cold pizza squares was waiting. The first slipped out of my fish hands. Then I got a grip.

That's just a fun story about the time Brad dared me to use hand lotion during an entire episode of **LOST**.
