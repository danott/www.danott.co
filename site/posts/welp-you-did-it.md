I told myself when this little newsletter received [redacted] subscribers I’d commit to the advertised message of fermenting my mind grapes into your inbox once a week.
Thanks for the boost in confidence that writing things down is worth the time.

Lately I’ve been thinking about vision.
And division.
And long division.
And long-held divisions that have gone unchallenged.
And longings for division to see it’s end.

The way I see it, these divisions are like a pair of glasses we wear to help us focus.

- Is this good, or is this bad?
- Does this harm me, or does it help me?
- Does this sacrifice for me, or does it require sacrifice from me?
- Does this boost my standing, or does it boost others' standing?

The problem is my focus is hindered by some heirloom glasses that are not suitable for diffusing the new light I'm encountering. The wrong spectacles of division can make life a blur. Perhaps to restore proper focus, I need to first unsee all my artificial divisions.

I find myself the blind man who was almost lost to the crowd.
