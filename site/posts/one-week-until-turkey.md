The holidays are upon us.\
Us.\
As in U.S.\
As in the U.S. of A.\
Thanksgiving and Christmas are the ones I was raised on.\
There are others.

And as is custom, it's time to slow down.\
Take a break.\
Writing from Labor Day to Thanksgiving is fun.\
I'm thankful for the labor set before me.\
The work now behind me.\
Hindsight in 2020.

Here's the deal.\
I'm tired on multiple fronts.\
And when the laptop closes on my workday next Wednesday, I don't plan to re-open it to write a newsletter that eve of thanks.

So here's me signing off for the year.\
See you back in this here inbox in 2021.

Mostly maybe.
