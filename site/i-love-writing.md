# I Love Writing

Be it creating a new file on disk, or turning a blank page.
The deliberate practice of it.
Neurons firing from forehead to finger.
Out of mind, into sight.
I love writing.

The closest approximation is my youth on guitar.
Not playing any specific song.
I would catch my self drooling, completely lost in the fun of it.
The endless combinations of strumming and fingering the fret board.
Every once in a while, a serendipitous melody emerged.

That's where I'm at, with the practice of writing.
Staring out the window, strumming, salivation setting in.
Knowing I enjoy the journey, without a destination, map, or landmark in mind.

Author's intended meaning, is to be an author.
About technology?
Poetry?
Philosophy?
Hot sauces?

Sure.

I know I want to write.
So here's some practice.
