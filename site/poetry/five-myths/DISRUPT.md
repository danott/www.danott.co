title: DISRUPT
---

Something is not right\
Something isn’t right\
Nothing left to write\
That hasn’t already been said

Melancholy apathy\
Wallflower desire\
Waiting for recognition of genius

You are a marketer\
The revenue reports

You are a worshiper\
The expenses report

Disruption is admission\
we want what our parents wanted\
Just with more dollars and fewer people
