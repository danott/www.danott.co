I'm going to begin writing every day.
Not for a specified amount of time.
Not for quality.
Just for practice.

[This blog post][] hammered home the idea for me.
I've heard this advice dozens of times.
Hundreds?
But something about Nate's wording made it stick.
Or at least, compelled me to action this day.

Frequency is more important than duration or quality.
With the first, the latter two come naturally.
So here's to tossing out huge audacious goals that invite failure.
Another toast to showing up frequently.

I should know this.
"90% of ministry is showing up consistently" I used to tell new volunteers.
But I would not show up consistently in my own desired habits.

So here's a third toast. To consistency!
