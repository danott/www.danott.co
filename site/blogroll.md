# Blogroll

As previously noted, I resist the nomenclature around blogging.
Some alternative ideas to supplant the title of _blogroll_ include:

- Links
- Likes
- Dotcomrades
- Recommended reading
- Follows
- Internet heroes
- Personal website moodboard

At the end of the day, it's a list of individuals' websites, RSS feeds, and/or newsletters that I draw inspiration from.
I've presented them in alphabetical order.

[Dave Rupert](https://daverupert.com)
: Dave writes regularly about developing for the web, and it's always insightful.

[Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org)
: I first heard of Derek when I read [Anything You Want](https://sive.rs/a).
Everything I've read sense then has made me stop and think.

[Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.design)
: Eric's ethos towards design and development is front and center.
The process of being developed in the open was a big inspiration in me doing the same.
Everything published here seems carefully considered, and worthy of the time needed for ingesting.

[Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com)
: I honestly don't remember how I first heard Frank.
It was around 2010'ish?
There's a back catalogue of worthwhile thoughts.  
I'd consider [Everything Easy is Hard Again](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/) required reading for everyone developing for the web browser.

[Hans Gerwitz](https://hans.gerwitz.com/)
: Hans' personal site is an inspiring archive.
The minimal navigation is unique, and works really well for the stated goals.

[Jamie's Notes](https://jamiesnotes.com)
: I can't recall how I stumbled upon this one. But it's a good'n.

[Jim Nielsen](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com)
: The regularity of digestible, interesting posts is a real treat.

[Joel Hooks](https://joelhooks.com)
: Joel's blog isn't a blog.
This digital garden is well tended, and provides a lot of interesting deep dives in the areas of entrepreneurship and online educational content.

[Joshua Blankenship](https://blankenship.xyz)
: Joshua's blog may have been among the first I subscribed to, way way way back.
Great takes on every area of life.

[Manton Reece](https://www.manton.org)
: Founder of [micro.blog](https://micro.blog), and publisher of all things indie.

[Mattias Ott](https://matthiasott.com)
: No relation, but the thoughts published definitely speak my language.

[Michael Chan](https://chan.dev)
: Michael and I met as partners-in-code at [Planning Center](https://www.planningcenter.com).
He's even better offline than he is online.
If you're in the React community, you've probably heard of him.
If not, you're welcome.

[Michael Lee](https://michaelsoolee.com/)
: I appreciate the balance of entrepreneurship, development, and real life content that Michael publishes.

[Ryan Singer](https://feltpresence.com)
: Ryan Singer is the Head of Product Strategy at Basecamp.
Tapping into his design process mind is super educational.

[Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com)
: Always with the understandable write-ups on interesting projects.
