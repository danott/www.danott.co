I needed to rebuild some git history today. 
It's never a fun task.

What I found while doing it, is that I was losing merge commits.
I found this out to late, after taking a much less efficient approach.
But if I ever encounter this problem in the future, the `--keep-empty` flag will be helpful.
As in

```
git rebase -interactive --keep-empty upstream
```
