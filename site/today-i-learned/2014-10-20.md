Small changes are easier than big changes. Renaming things seems like a huge
win, but when you're renaming big things, small subtleties will emerge. These
pitfalls are easier to see in others' proposed changes than your own.

If you're going to rename something, have a good purpose for it.

Look for the dumb solution. Sometimes refactoring isn't needed yet. You don't
know enough about the problem to find the better solution, yet.
