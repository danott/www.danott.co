I've been building a system that imports a lot of records from another system.
The items from the other system have stable identifiers, but many other attributes will change.

In the past I've handled this scenario by iterating on each record, and individually "upsetting" into the local database.
It would look something like

```ruby
entries = RemoteSystem.new.entries
entries.each do |entry|
  attributes = entry_attributes_from_remote_system(entry)
  Entry.find_or_initialize_by(identifier: attributes.fetch("identifier").update(attributes)
end
```

This works fine and good, but I learned there's a better way! Rails 6 introduced [upsert_all][].
With this new method, many round trips to the database are replaced with one command.

```ruby
entries = RemoteSystem.new.entries
entries_attributes = entries.map { |entry| entry_attributes_from_remote_system(entry) }
Entry.upsert_all(entries_attributes, unique_by: %w[identifier])
```

The one gotcha I've found so far, is that it fails if `entries_attributes` is an empty array.
Easily mitigated with a presence check.

```ruby
Entry.upsert_all(entries_attributes, unique_by: %w[identifier]) unless entries_attributes.blank?
```
