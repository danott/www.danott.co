Aggressively eliminate state. After working with ReactJS for a bit, I am
starting to see the merits of eliminating state. I'm even beginning to like
methods prefixed with `get` and `set`. Eliminating state means eliminating
side-effects.

Writing adolescent JS code seems to lead to better JS code. What I mean by
adolescent code, is that it refuses to take responsibility. It lets somebody
else own the state of the world. All it does is ask for values, and do something
with them.

If you want to launch Vim from a Ruby script, use `system 'vim'`. Backticks
won't work, because they want to consume STDOUT. `exec` takes over the process,
so you couldn't do work afterwords. `system` works.
