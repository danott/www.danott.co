Something I really like from [React Native][] is the global variable `__DEV__`.
Being able to do things only in the development environment is quite handy.
This concept is not unique to React Native, but that's where I was introduced to it.

I've found myself in need of a similar strategy while building this static site in Rails.
I have some dynamic interactions that I can use to curate content on my own machine, but I don't want those scripts bloating the static build that is deployed to production.

This can be achived in Rails with [webpacker][] using Webpack's [DefinePlugin][]!

```js
// config/webpacker/environment.js
const { environment } = require("@rails/webpacker")
const webpack = require("webpack")

environment.plugins.prepend(
  "Define",
  new webpack.DefinePlugin({
    STATIC: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  }),
)

module.exports = environment
```
