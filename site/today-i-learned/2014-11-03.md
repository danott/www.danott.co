`git log --pretty=oneline` gives you the one-line per a commit output.

`git log --pretty=format:"%an"` gives you formatting on commits. All the
interpolations available are listed in the `man git-log` under "PRETTY FORMATS".

`attr_readonly` exists in Rails for making fields immutable. But we're in Rails,
so we don't use big words like immutable, we use readonly. Caveat: you can still
change the values in memory, which has other consequences around validations and
any derived values.
