Reminded of a proposal I made long ago. For responsive design, start at one
size, and head in one direction, using either min-width or max-width, but not
both.

I spent time today moving some behavior of a model into a concern, specific to
that model. Rather than putting it into
`app/models/concerns/person_pending_request_count` I put it into
`app/models/person/pending_request_count`. I liked this change, because it
communicated that only Person should be using this. It's not a general mixin,
though it could easily become one. Then in the person class, I just included
it with `include Person::PendingRequestCount`.
