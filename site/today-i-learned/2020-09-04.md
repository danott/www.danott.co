I built a Rails mailer for the first time in a very long time today.
Revisiting [the docs](), I was greeted with a signature I didn't recall from the past.

```
Mailer.with(some: "params", set: "this way").email_name.deliver_later
```

In the past, I'd always invoked mailers with

```
Mailer.email_name(some: "params", set: "this way").deliver_later
```

The `with` message feels very aligned with `ActiveJob.set`. 
For things that are needed on all mailers, like the _recipient_, I like standardizing on this approach for communicating params into the mailer.
