You can be incredibly productive, but feel unproductive. Fixing lots of small
bugs leads to this. Keeping a list of everything completed such as Trello helps
you remember that you're making a lot of small progress when it feels like
you're not making any large progress.

There are many ways to write even the simplest statement.

```ruby
# Whitelisted arguments.  # Which is most readable while being concise?

# 1
trusted = %w[approve reject].find { |i| i == untrusted }

# 2
trusted = (%w[approve reject] & [untrusted]).first

# 3
trusted = %w[approve reject].include?(untrusted) ? untrusted : nil

# 4
trusted = case untrusted; when *%w[approve reject]; untrusted; end
```
