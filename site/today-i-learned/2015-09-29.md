You are not allowed to complain about what you are not willing to confront. I saw that in a tweet a while ago, and it is a good word.

Prefixing methods that will change what is on output to the screen with `render_` sounds verbose, but it has been helpful as I've started to use it more. Another `React` convention that is informing other areas of development.
