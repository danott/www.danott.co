Rails UJS' `ajax:success` and `ajax:error` only apply to XHRs originating from
a `data-remote="true"` source. If you'd like them to apply to all XHRs in your
page or application, you're gonna have to wire that up.

In slim, you can use `<`, `>` or both after your tag to add leading or
trailing whitespace, respectively.
