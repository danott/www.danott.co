React Native's `<StatusBar />` component behaves similarly to `<Helmet />` from [react-helmet][].
Render them anywhere in the tree.
Every time an element is rendered, it's props get pushed onto the top of a stack that will reconcile as a cascade of props for imperatively updating outside values.

[The source][] of `StatusBar.js` was particularly helpful, because I discovered it just as I was arriving at a near-identical solution for doing something similar in an app I'm working on.
