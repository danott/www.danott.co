`Rails.env.test?` is always preferable to writing `Rails.env == "test"`.
The behavior that powers this predicate method is the `ActiveSupport::StringInquirer` class.

This is not new information. 
But what was new, is finding the `.inquiry` method that is added to a whole bunch of objects, including strings and arrays..

```
"test".inquiry.test?
%w[this that other].inquiry.other?
```

Neat!
