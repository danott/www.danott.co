Sometimes you install one gem.

```bash
gem install bundler
```

Sometimes you install it with a specific version.

```bash
gem install bundler -v "2.0.2"
```

Sometimes you install multiple gems.

```bash
gem install bundler minitest
```

But what do you do if you need to install multiple gems with specific versions?
It is possible with a special syntax!

```bash
gem install "bundler:2.0.2" "minitest:5.13.0"
```
